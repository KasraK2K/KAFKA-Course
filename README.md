# Learn Kafka Course

---

In this repository i will try to teach everything i know about Kafka in a simple way like:
- Create Document
- Share good reference and document to read and dive in deeper
- Write some example codes

_To do this, I have used many resources and tutorials, the summary of which I will share with you_

If you wish to be easy to read and comfortable with this document you can use [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) application as like me.
Obsidian is a beautiful and free application that help you to write markdown file better and create graph of your document easily.

At the end i try to share some useful tools you can use with Kafka to have better experience.
